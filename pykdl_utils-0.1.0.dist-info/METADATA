pykdl_utils contains kdl_parser.py, for parsing URDF objects
from the robot_model_py stack into PyKDL trees and chains, 
and kdl_kinematics.py, for wrapping KDL kinematics calls, making
kinematics requests in Python far simpler.  jointspace_kdl_kin.py
also contains a KDLKinematics superclass which subscribes to /joint_states,
automatically filling the FK and jacobian requests with the current joint
angles.
